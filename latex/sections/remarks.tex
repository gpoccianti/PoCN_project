Part of the code was generated with the assistance of ChatGPT (v4); however, it was never used blindly. 

For instance, this tool helped build functions for calculating the \( U \) order parameter, generating videos, plotting networks, and converting between degrees and DMS formats. Moreover, it suggested useful packages, such as \textsl{tigris}. 

Finally, it was helpful in checking grammar and making minor adjustments to improve the readability of the text.
